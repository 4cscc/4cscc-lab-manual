# The Four Corners Science and Computing Club (4CSCC) Lab Notebook

This is the very beginning stages of a book introducing scientific computing
using the Raspberry Pi 400 computer, physical computing, microbiome science,
and [QIIME 2](https://qiime2.org).

This is a collaborative effort between members of the Four Corners Science and
Computing Club team.

```{warning}
This content is in a very early stage of development, and not yet ready for use
in self-learning. **At present, the examples in this book will only work on a specific
Raspberry Pi disk image created for 4CSCC.**
```

```{note}
Before running any of the Python 3 code in this book, you'll need to run the following command:

    source ~/code/4cscc-ln/venv/bin/activate

(We'll have more portable install and usage instructions in the future.)
```
